                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm Elroe, a a senior Informatics student at the University of Washington, specializing in Data Science. My passion for using technology to solve real-world problems began with personal experiences in Ethiopia, where I witnessed the challenges in both transportation and healthcare access. These experiences inspired me to focus on creating technology-driven solutions that improve people's lives, particularly in underserved communities.

                    During a study abroad program in Ethiopia, I conducted research on public transportation efficiency, which led me to propose a Real-Time Bus Tracking Mobile App aimed at reducing wait times for commuters in Addis Ababa. Alongside my transportation work, I have also been deeply involved in health data visualization. I worked on a research project that explored how immigrant households understand COVID-19 data, developing new ways of visualizing healthcare information that goes beyond traditional graphs to make data more accessible and meaningful.
                    
                    By designing interactive visualizations that represent different layers of social support—family, friends, community, healthcare systems—I aim to help people make informed healthcare decisions. My work is driven by the desire to close the gap between healthcare systems and the communities they serve, particularly when faith and cultural values play a key role in decision-making.</p>
