            <h3>Project 1: Computing For All (Web Developer)</h3>
            <p><strong>Duration: June 2023 - Present</strong><br>
               <strong>Description:</strong><br>
               For this project, I created a music platform that functions similarly to Spotify. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build a website where users can easily upload and discover new music. I added features like discussion channels for fans to connect, personalized playlists, and a merchandise store for artists. My goal was to make it easy and fun for users to interact with their favorite artists. I also worked on making the site mobile-friendly and added secure e-commerce options for buying merchandise.

            <h3>Project 4: Plant Parenthood (Developer)</h3>
            <p><strong>Duration: January 2023 - March 2023</strong><br>
               <strong>Description:</strong><br>
               I built a digital plant care app that allows users to track their plantsâ€™ growth through personalized care schedules and visual galleries. Users can upload photos of their plants at different stages of growth, annotate them with notes, and create a comprehensive care diary. The app integrates Firebase for secure data storage, offering real-time updates and reminders to ensure optimal plant care. </p>

            <h3>Project 2: iSchool Study Abroad Ethiopia | Researcher</h3>
            <p>During this research project in Ethiopia, I helped lead a study aimed at improving the long wait times people face with public transportation. We interviewed commuters, collected survey data, and observed the daily challenges people experience with buses. Based on this research, we proposed a real-time bus tracking app that would allow commuters to see when their bus is coming. Over 75% of the people we surveyed supported the idea. This project taught me a lot about working together as a team and using data to solve real problems.

            <h3>Visualizing COVID-19 Health Data</h3>
            <p><strong>Duration: April 2023 - May 2023</strong><br>
               <strong>Description:</strong><br>
               In this project, I am working on developing interactive visualizations that help present COVID-19 health data in a clear and accessible way. Using Processing, JavaScript, and Java, I create graphics that show how users understand and interact with the data. Additionally, I co-designed health visuals that are culturally relevant, using generative AI to ensure they align with the community's values. Based on insights from over 50 participants, we are building a website with Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to showcase these visuals and present our findings on how to effectively communicate health information.</p>

            <h3>Database Management System for Nordstrom Catalog</h3>
            <p><strong>Duration: April 2023 - May 2023</strong><br>
               <strong>Description:</strong><br>
               In this project, I worked on a database system to help Nordstrom manage their product inventory and customer orders more efficiently. I used SQL to write queries that made it easier to organize and retrieve data from multiple tables, improving how the company tracks and manages their products. I also created an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to better structure the data and reduce duplication, which made the system run faster and more effectively for both employees and customers.</p>

            <h3>Patient-Prioritizer| Java REPO January 2024- March 2024</h3>
            <p><strong>Duration: January 2023 - March 2023</strong><br>
               <strong>Description:</strong><br>
               I developed a Java-based system to prioritize hospital patients for triage based on factors such as age, zip code, insurance status, pain level, and temperature. The system calculates a priority score for each patient, flagging those with the highest need for immediate care. It efficiently tracks and evaluates multiple patients, summarizing results at the end of each session.</p>
